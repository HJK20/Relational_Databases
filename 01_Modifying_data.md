# Modifying data

##### Insert 

```sql
INSERT INTO [table_name]
	([attribute_1], [attribute_2], [attribute_3]) /* 如果这个表只有三列，这行可以不写 */
	VALUES 
		([value1_for_row1], [value2_for_row1], [value3_for_row1]),
		([value1_for_row2], [value2_for_row2], [value3_for_row2]); 
```

* `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` is the simplest way to insert data into a table. There's not a whole lot to discuss here: `VALUES` is used to construct a row of data, which the `INSERT` statement inserts into the table. 
* primary key 一定要赋值，剩下的可以不写，没赋值的列会变成null

##### Update

```sql
UPDATE [table_name]
    SET 
    	[colunm_1] = [new_value_1],
    	[colunm_2] = [new_value_2]
    WHERE [condition]; 
```

* The `UPDATE` statement is used to alter existing data. the `WHERE` clause works in exactly the same fashion, allowing us to filter the set of rows we want to work with. These rows are then modified according to the specifications of the `SET` clause: in this case, setting the initial outlay.

* The `SET` clause accepts a comma separated list of values that you want to update.

##### Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM [table_name];
```

* The `DELETE` statement does what it says on the tin: deletes rows from the table. In this case, it deletes everything from the table. But the table still **exist**.
* 删除表用`DROP TABLE [table_name];`

```sql
DELETE FROM [table_name] 
WHERE [conditions_on_some_rows];   
```

* we simply have to add a `WHERE` clause to our command, specifying the member we want to delete. 

###### Delete based on a subquery

```sql
DELETE FROM [table_1] 
WHERE [attribute_name] NOT IN 
	(SELECT [attribute_name] FROM [table_2]);       
```

* We can use subqueries to determine whether a row should be deleted or not. 
* The subquery produces a list of all the different member in the attribute in table_2. If a row in the table_1 isn't in the list generated by the subquery, it gets deleted.
